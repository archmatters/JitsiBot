# JitsiBot
A simple Jitsi bot for Mastodon.

Mention the bot in a toot with the code phrase "toot that horn" (or a recognized variation, e.g. "blow on your horn" also works), and the bot will notify all its followers that the configured Jitsi room is in session.

## Proboscis
This project includes a Mastodon interface library I developed specifically for this project, Proboscis.  Eventually this may be split out into its own project, but for now it's small enough I'll leave it part of this.

## Configuration
Configuration for the project is all in config.json, except for those items I have hardcoded, of course.
